	- Looked into dell laptop power settings, external display goes blank too quick:
		- To prevent your laptop from going to sleep and to keep the screen on when an external display is connected, you can adjust the power and display settings in Pop!_OS. Here's how you can do it:
		- -1. **Open the Settings**: Click on the system menu in the top-right corner of your screen (it looks #like a gear icon). Then, click on "Settings."
		- -2. **Power Settings**:
			- In the Settings window, select "Power" on the left-hand menu.
			- Under the "Blank Screen" section, you can adjust the time for "Blank screen" and "Suspend when inactive." Set these options to "Never" to prevent the laptop from going to sleep or turning off the screen due to inactivity.
		- 3. **Display Settings**:
			- To ensure the external display stays on, click on "Displays" in the left-hand menu.
			- You should see both your laptop screen and the external display listed. Click on the external display.
			- Make sure that the "Active" toggle is turned on for the external display. This ensures that the external display remains active even when the laptop lid is closed.
		- 4. **Laptop Lid Settings**:
			- To make sure your laptop doesn't go to sleep when you close the lid while using an external display, you can configure lid settings.
			- Open a terminal and run the following command to edit the systemd logind configuration file:
			- ```
			  bashCopy code
			  - sudo nano /etc/systemd/logind.conf
			  ```
			- In the #file, find the line that starts with `#HandleLidSwitch=` and change it to `HandleLidSwitch=ignore`.
				- Setting was: #HandleLidSwitch=suspend
			- Save the #file (Ctrl+O, then Enter) and exit (Ctrl+X).
			- Restart your laptop or run `sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind` to apply the changes.
		- These settings should help you keep your laptop screen on and prevent it from going to sleep when you have an external display connected. Please note that adjusting system settings may require administrative privileges, so ensure you have the necessary permissions to make these changes.
		- Remember that maintaining power settings is important for power management and the longevity of your laptop, so you may want to revert these settings to their default values when not using an external display or when on battery power to conserve energy.
