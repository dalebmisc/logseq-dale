## Scratchpad
	- Created page for [[vscode]]
	- Created page for [[pycharm]]
	- Add autopep8 formatter to [[vscode]]
	- Fixed the [[GitHub]] push issue in [[vscode]] for logseq-dale branch
		- A push was having trouble authenticating and suggesting I need to use a PAT
			- I compared local [[git]] settings between logseq-dale and general and to match to general
				- ```terminal
				  git config --list --local
				  For each config setting I want to remove in logseq-dale:  E.g. core.quotepath
				  git config --unset core.quotepath
				  ```
- ## [[TODO]] {{renderer :todomaster}} #[[todo progress]]
	- TODO Convert kindle format to text or pdf, start with Naemm's book
		- Undersirable option is 'web scraping' the text.
