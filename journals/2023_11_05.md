		- Today, I want to cover the different causes and remedies for rib pain or costochondritis.
		- The first symptom of costochondritis is chest pain. So, it can sometimes be mistaken as a heart problem. The typical treatments for costochondritis are medications, steroids, or injections.
		- The cause of costochondritis is considered unknown. However, from my experience, I think there are two primary causes:
		- 1. An old injury to the front chest cavity or an injury in the back part of your ribs or spine.
		- 2. A vitamin D deficiency.
		- Unilateral sports, like golf, tennis, or baseball, may also lead to this condition. If your pain is on the lower right side of your rib cage, it may be caused by a gallbladder issue. In my opinion, even spending a lot of time in front of a computer could lead to this condition.
		- One of the best natural remedies for costochondritis is vitamin D. I would take 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 a day along with 100 mcg of vitamin K2 (the MK7 version).
		- Certain stretches and exercises may also help with this condition as well as promote relaxation and sleep. The mobility stick or the massage device I created are great tools to help with these stretches.
