				- ### Highlights
					- > A big part of any show is who it chooses to include. So, we began by breaking down the demographics of Shark Tank contestants. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/shark-tank-deep-dive-a-data-analysis-of-all-10-seasons-the-hustl-18bc01eefcc#44543b50-481a-4ab3-b754-62bed6e2ef62)
					- > We’ll come back to this disparity in a bit — but first, let’s take a big-picture look at what types of businesses these 895 contestants pitched on the show. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/shark-tank-deep-dive-a-data-analysis-of-all-10-seasons-the-hustl-18bc01eefcc#b0959fe2-c963-4cd3-8054-21edf5bb7926)
					- > Between season 1 and season 10, food and beverage pitches increased by 15 percentage points. In that same period, ideas for children’s products tanked by 10 percentage points. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/shark-tank-deep-dive-a-data-analysis-of-all-10-seasons-the-hustl-18bc01eefcc#82b43b62-ce03-48cc-ade5-23e24c08151e)
					- > Though under-represented on Shark Tank, 60% of women who made it onto the show (133 of 221) got a deal, compared to 53% of men (284 of 535). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/shark-tank-deep-dive-a-data-analysis-of-all-10-seasons-the-hustl-18bc01eefcc#be984ca1-a238-438c-9623-0f459afe84fb)
					- > Ten years ago, only 42% of hopefuls got a deal; this past season, that figure was up to a whopping 68%. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/shark-tank-deep-dive-a-data-analysis-of-all-10-seasons-the-hustl-18bc01eefcc#9da7ecd6-1a77-4819-a340-acef9120f92b)
					- > The average contestant asks for $301k, is only willing to sacrifice 13% of his/her company, and seeks a $3.6m valuation. But like most things in life, expectations often fall a bit short of reality. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/shark-tank-deep-dive-a-data-analysis-of-all-10-seasons-the-hustl-18bc01eefcc#be39c603-3ccc-49b7-99ec-3ab59708d95e)
					- > When the show first began, the average contestant had to give up half of his/her company in exchange for much smaller valuation. Over time, the equity stake sharks take from contestants has greatly diminished (and valuation has gone up commensurately). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/shark-tank-deep-dive-a-data-analysis-of-all-10-seasons-the-hustl-18bc01eefcc#d3e1f3c6-20bf-4ea3-8174-399c218a54bd)
					- > A look at the highest and lowest valuations in Shark Tank history shows that from this point onward, deals began to skyrocket in size — and the overwhelming majority (80%) of the show’s biggest deals went to male entrepreneurs. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/shark-tank-deep-dive-a-data-analysis-of-all-10-seasons-the-hustl-18bc01eefcc#fea44ec3-b929-4022-b7e1-118d84bc829e)
					- > Though Shark Tank has seen a rotating cast of guest investors (ranging from baseball superstar Alex Rodriguez to actor Ashton Kutcher), the panel has largely been made up of 6 people:
					  Mark Cuban (billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks)
					  Barbara Corcoran (NYC real estate mogul)
					  Lori Greiner (the “Queen of QVC”)
					  Robert Herjavec (computer and IT security founder)
					  Daymond John (founder of FUBU clothing brand)
					  Kevin O’Leary (software mogul)
					  Let’s look at their investment history. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/shark-tank-deep-dive-a-data-analysis-of-all-10-seasons-the-hustl-18bc01eefcc#d5efad05-ccc4-42fd-84f7-ee52d28f1e12)
					- > For fun, we wanted to see how the sharks’ total Shark Tank investments stacked up to their purported net worth (gleaned from Investopedia). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/shark-tank-deep-dive-a-data-analysis-of-all-10-seasons-the-hustl-18bc01eefcc#82d75cf6-203b-4c2f-a083-e9bcfd04a4d1)
					- > Lastly, given the show’s gender disparity, we wanted to check the sharks’ track record of investing in female-led companies. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/shark-tank-deep-dive-a-data-analysis-of-all-10-seasons-the-hustl-18bc01eefcc#14cbc3a4-b5f3-4535-b65c-b6359ea4a806)
