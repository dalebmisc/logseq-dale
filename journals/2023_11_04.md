	- 2023-11-10, I won't pursue this any further, it appears the extensions are running into an issue using the api which seems separate from the chatgpt I am paying for.  I am on the free tier with the api and it isn't clear why it isn't working.  Not a big priority at this time to spend more time on it.
- TODO get the amazon plugin working that helps write code and try to be more productive with it
- DONE bring in some other markdown files from work that I may want to build out from work and home with shared knowledge, figure out how to keep them in sync, and how does the table of Contents plugin work on them?
