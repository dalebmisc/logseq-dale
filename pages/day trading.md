- Strategy: Gap over +/- 3% without any news including no analyst price targets
	- Do not do:
		- Place a price target to get in trade
			- Because the price may go well through the target and you start out in a serious hole
		- Jumping in as soon as price target hits being in fear of missing out
			- Because the price may go well through the target and you start out in a serious hole
			- This is more when I am looking for a reversal in price, for example if price get to this level then I will short
		- Not considering the trend on the daily chart
