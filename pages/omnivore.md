			- > Follow along with our example commands below to update your Flatpak applications (commonly just called “flatpaks”) on a Linux system, whether you want to update a particular package or just bring all installed apps up to date.
			  Usually, you will just want to update all of your installed applications with a single command. That can be accomplished by executing:
			  > 
			  $ sudo flatpak update
			  > 
			  If, instead, you would like to update an individual application, you can supply the --app argument and specify which application you want to update. For example, this command would update the GIMP package downloaded from FlatHub:
			  > 
			  $ sudo flatpak update --app org.gimp.GIMP [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-update-flatpak-application-linux-tutorials-learn-linux-co-18bbf15a021#54324595-1eaa-4497-9130-deae3fb03481)
