	- Fixed the [[GitHub]] push issue in [[vscode]] for logseq-dale branch
		- A push was having trouble authenticating and suggesting I need to use a PAT
			- I compared local [[git]] settings between logseq-dale and general and to match to general
				- ```terminal
				  git config --list --local
				  For each config setting I want to remove in logseq-dale:  E.g. core.quotepath
				  git config --unset core.quotepath
				  ```
